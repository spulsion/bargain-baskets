I need to refresh my memory on this but this folder is for the backend handling the fetch stores locally and the cloudworker
do 
npx wrangler dev 
after running the front end

- so far able to grab the users longitude and lat and relay that information to the Google Places API to see what stores are nearby
dont hardcode user store radius
